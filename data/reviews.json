Loved our rooms, owners and staff go above and beyond to do things for you. Cleaners were brilliant as well! Large rooms, really clean. Does an awesome breakfast and the pool is the best in the area in fairness! Stayed twice this year! 100% recommend!","relativeTime":"4 months ago"},{"name":"Stewart Mason","photo":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhQ4qJVuih8_O2cSkrvBl2HRHxP08kt2Fa0ReE3zw=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"text":"Excellent service  staff extremely helpful and friendly\nVery clean room","relativeTime":"6 months ago"},{"name":"Clive Fellows","photo":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AATXAJxlyl6N7q-qCQD7ed21NM_Lskv2znPAmvc8WDFH=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":4,"text":"Good place to stay very helpful","relativeTime":"5 months ago"}],"status":"OK"}
