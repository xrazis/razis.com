Loved our rooms, owners and staff go above and beyond to do things for you. Cleaners were brilliant as well! Large rooms, really clean. Does an awesome breakfast and the pool is the best in the area in fairness! Stayed twice this year! 100% recommend!","relativeTime":"a week ago"},{"name":"Ana Piskaceva","photo":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gh2egseG5y6-kAnleLB_oMqUy7jAj6rQ4DgwNVKUA=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3","rating":5,"text":"The rooms might be basic, but they are perfectly clean and have everything needed for a pleasant stay- including a comfortable mattress and a safe box. The staff is absolutely wonderful- and was there to help us with absolutely anything we needed- including our special diet needs, and care for our motorcycle (bike riders- you will feel right at home here!)üòÅ. We had the most delicious home-made breakfast every morning and the warms smiles of Andreas and his wife just made everything even nicer! The location is perfect- in a lively little town, that is yet not crazy with the parties and teenagers, like some of the other places on the island. I fully recommend for a peaceful and relaxed stay on Zakynthos!","relativeTime":"2 months ago"},{"name":"Stewart Mason","photo":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhQ4qJVuih8_O2cSkrvBl2HRHxP08kt2Fa0ReE3zw=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"text":"Excellent service  staff extremely helpful and friendly\nVery clean room","relativeTime":"3 months ago"}]}
